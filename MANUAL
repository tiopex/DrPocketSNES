## GUI Manual

### <<<< HOW TO LOAD ROMS FROM MENU >>>>

1.	Start PocketSnes
2. 	Select "Select Rom" from the menu.
3. 	This will take you by default to the current working directory (e.g the directory where you installed DrPocketSnes /mnt/emus/DrPocketSnes.
4. 	You now need to browse through the file system to find your rom directory.
5. 	To do this select ".." to move up and directory or select any entries that start with "+".  Entries that start with "+" are directories, so selecting takes you into that directory.
6. 	Once you have located your rom directory, you need to save the current directory as your default rom directory.
7. 	To do this select the "Back To Main Menu" menu option.
8. 	Then select "SNES Options"
9. 	Then select "Save Current Rom Directory"
10.	This will store the current rom directory in a text file held in the options directory. So the next time you start PocketSnes and select "Select Rom" you will be taken straight to your rom directory.

### <<<< MENU OPTIONS >>>>
_______________________________________________	
Return To Game  
	If you have a rom loaded this will allow to exit the menu and return to the game.
_______________________________________________	
Select Rom  
	Takes you to the Rom Selection screen which allows you load a new game.
_______________________________________________		
Manage Save States  
	Takes you to the save state management screen.  Save states allow you to save your current position in the currently loaded game.  This means that you can reload a particular position in the game as many times as you want.
_______________________________________________	
Save Sram  
	Allows you save the current contents of SRAM to a file.  SRAM is the battery backup ram which used to be on the Snes cartridges.  This allowed high scores or game progress, so that the next time you loaded the snes game you could continue where you left off.  If you plan to use save states then you don't need to worry about SRAM saves as the save state holds all of this information as well.
_______________________________________________	
SNES Options  
	Takes you into the options screen which allows you to customise how the emulator runs. See "SNES Options - In Detail" for more information on each of the settings.
_______________________________________________
Reset Game  
	Allows you to reset the current rom, its the same as reloading the rom apart from you don't have to read the rom file from the SD card again.
_______________________________________________	
Exit Application  
	Exits PocketSnes and reloaded the frontend menu.

### <<<< SNES OPTIONS >>>>
_______________________________________________
Sound  
	Allows you to turn the sound on or off
_______________________________________________	
Sound Rate  
	Allows you to configure the sample rate of the sound emulation.  The high the rate the clearer and more accurate the sound.
_______________________________________________
Volumne  
	Allows you setup default volume levels.  Volume can also be controlled using the volume controls on the GP2X.
_______________________________________________	
Cpu Speed  
	Allows you select the GP2X cpu speed to be used when emulating the Snes.  The higher the cpu speed the smoother the emulation is ( plus it drains you battery more)
_______________________________________________	
FrameSkip  
	Allows you to control how many frames are not rendered, this can allow you to keep full speed emulation when at low cpu speeds. AUTO will skip as many frames as needed in order to maintain full speed emulation.
_______________________________________________	
Action Buttons  
	The GP2X has the same button as the snes but the buttons are in the wrong order.  This option allows you to have the same button names as the snes, or to have the same button positions as snes.
	NORMAL = same button names as Snes
	SWAPPED = same button positions as Snes
_______________________________________________	
Show FPS  
	This allows you to see how man frames are being rendered per second.  This can allow you to see how the emulator is performing.
_______________________________________________	
Brightness  
	This allows you to control the current brightness of the screen.  You can make it darker or brighter.
_______________________________________________	
Transparencies  
	The SNES has very complicated graphics hardware which can be quite slow to emulate.  Switching off transparencies can improve performce but makes some games unplayable because you can not see all of the information that you need.
_______________________________________________	
Render Mode  
	Allows you to scale the emulated SNES graphics.  The normal SNES screen resolution is less than the GP2X's, so when in unscaled mode the graphics appear in a window.  If you select the scaled mode then the graphics are stretched to fill the screen.
_______________________________________________	
RAM Timing  
	This allows you select faster ram timings.  This can improve performance.  If you change this option you need to restart PocketSnes because these settings are only applied as the emulator is first started.
_______________________________________________	
MMU Hack  
	This option allows you to enable the MMU hack developed by Squidge.  This option massively improves performance and is recommended.  Again if you change this option you need to restart PocketSnes because these settings are only applied as the emulator is first started.
_______________________________________________	
Saving SRAM  
	This option allows you to control how the SRAM is saved to you SD card.  If you select automatic then SRAM will be saved automatically everytime you return to the menu if it has been modified during the last run of emulation.  If you select the manual option then SRAM will only be saved when you select the Save SRAM menu option from the main menu.
_______________________________________________	
Load Global Settings  
	This option will reload the global settings.  Global Settings affect all games as long as the games does not have a setting file of its own ( See Load Settings for current game). 
_______________________________________________	
Save Global Settings  
	This option allows you to save the current settings to the SD card.  Everytime you load a new rom these settings will be reloaded, so basically they become you default settings.  This can be overwritten using the "Save Settings For Current Game" option which allows you to save a config file for a particular rom. So each time you load the rom these settings will automatically be loaded.
_______________________________________________	
Delete Global Settings  
	Deletes any global setting file that has been created.  If you have no global setting file then PocketSnes will use its own internal default settings when loading a new rom.
_______________________________________________	
Load Settings For Current Game  
	This option will load any setting file associated with the currently loaded rom.
_______________________________________________	
Save Settings For Current Game  
	This option allows you to save a config file for the currently loaded rom. So each time you load this rom these settings will automatically be loaded instead of the global settings.
_______________________________________________	
Delete Settings For Current Game  
	Deletes any config file for the currently loaded rom.
_______________________________________________	
Save Current Rom Directory  
	This option allows you to save the current rom directory as you default rom directory.
