Version 7.2.1v2 for PocketGo, Release Date 13/12/2020  (closed-source release)

Changes by Bitrider  
Tons of help from A600 
Graphics by XiM

One of the big changes in 7.2 (from 7.1) is a hack called "Delayed Raster FX". It's active by default.
SNES9x updated screen on every change that affect it (colors, sprites position, graphic mode, ...) it causes some slow down due to cache misses.
Activating "Delayed Raster FX" screen will be update just once per frame, storing every change and applying it at the end of the frame.

On the original machine (Wiz and Caanoo) it would give about 80-100% extra fps due to those machines arch (arm 926, 16 bit bus). 
On PocketGo it gives a nice boost but not so big (same arm 926 but faster memory, wider bus -32 bit- ).  

This hack can cause some glitches (wrong colors, graphics errors), if you find any undesirable glitch deactivate it (you will loose some fps). 

PocketGo release has been possible due to big help provided by A600: setting up QEMU emulator, toolchain and sample code.

	Thanks goes to: 
		Buba-ho-tep, Rivroner (beta testers) 
		Anarchy (GP32Spain webmaster & conding contest promoter)
		Head-On-Heels (v 6.5.0 developer)
		Notaz, Squidge, Little Johnz & all those who contributed to this wonderful emulator.

- Added: deep changes to SPC 700 assembly core, now it is faster.
	- moved a few registers 
	- less reads/writes to memory
	- implemented GetByteZ, GetByte, SetByteZ & SetByte in ARM assembly
- Added: modifications to 65c816 assembly core, a little bit faster.
	- moved several flags from memory to status register.
	- implemented SetPCBase in ARM assembly.
	- SetDSP & GetDSP called directly (S9x_SetDSP & S9x_GetDSP where just wrapper functions with no added value).
	- Assembly CPU code splitted in several files (modularity purposes)
- Added: 4 different assembly APU (SPC 700) cycle sizes: 13, 14, 15 & 21. 
	Now more games are compatible with fast executable & fast mode on compatible executable : 
	Human's ones (Firemen, ...), Secret of evermore, Clock Tower (yeah, I know it's also by Human but a special case) that one is for you Buba. 
- Added: 16 bit fast assembly renderers for:
	tile: opaque, add, add 1/2, add fix 1/2, sub, sub 1/2, sub fix 1/2
	tile clipped: opaque, add, add 1/2, add fix 1/2, sub, sub 1/2, sub fix 1/2
	mode 7 just one layer: solid, solid with priority, add, add 1/2, sub, sub 1/2
	mode 7 with priorities (two layers): solid, add, add 1/2, sub, sub 1/2.
	subscreen filling: solid, add, add 1/2, sub, sub 1/2
- Added: SpeedHacks (rom patching with snesadvance.dat) to fast executable
- Added: a switch to enable/disable speed hacks, "Apply snesadvance.dat on ROM load".
- Added: Super FX emulation to fast executable version.
- Added: last played ROM loading at PocketSNES startup 
- Added: a switch to enable/disable last played ROM loading at startup
- Added: persistent selector in ROM list selector 
	 Last selected ROM will continue being focused when you launch a ROM 
	 and go back to the menu to select another ROM. (idea by Buba-ho-tep, thanks man.)
	 It does work only when you are in default PocketSNES ROM directory
- Added: display ROM file name while loading.
- Added: on ROM load error display error, pause & show "Push a button to continue".
- Added: fast version (65c816 assembly emulation) will show as "v 7.0.0 fast"
	 compatible version (65c816 C emulation) will show as "v 7.0.0 compatible" 
- Added: the ability to use Fast (assembly SPC-700) or Compatible (C SPC-700), more games playable on fast executable.
	 - So "Emulation (Reset Required): Compatible/Fast" switch is now available on fast executable. 
- Fixed: Auto save SRAM should only save when a change occurred
- Added: "Manual + indicator" to SRAM saving options
	 A disk will be displayed on the lower right corner of the screen when SRAM data is awaiting 
	 Note: disk won't be visible if screen is resized
- Added: a little bit optimized sound block decode routine.

Version 6	Release Date 04/02/2007
___________________________________
	1. Fixed a bug on the rom browsing code.  Strings were not being terminated correctly.  
___________________________________
Version 5	Release Date 03/02/2007
___________________________________
	1. Changed the way SRAM works.  The old versions of PocketSnes used a timer to check if SRAM had changed while the SNES emulator was running.  If a change was detected the SRAM was saved straight away.  This used to cause glitches in the framerate.  SRAM is now saved when you enter the menu as long as you have SRAM saving set to automatic in the options menu.
	2. Added options to allow you to switch MMU hack on or off
	3. Added options to allow you to switch Craigx's RAM settings on or off.
	4. Fixed problems where data was not being saved to SD card correctly, I was missing a few calls to sync()
	5. I've tidied up the installation directory abit.  Most things used to be stored in the options sub directory and somethings were saved to the root installation directory, which was a bit of a mess.  So I've now created the following 3 directories in order to make things more logical.
	
	options (*.opt)		- used to hold global and individual game settings
	savestate (*.sv*) 	- used to hold save states for all games
	sram (*.srm)		- used to hold SRAM saves for all games
	
	This means that we you upgrade from Version 4 to Version 5 you will need to manually copy the savestates out of the options directory and into the savestate directory in order for PocketSnes to recognise them.  You will also have to move the SRAM files out of the root installation directory and into the sram directory.
